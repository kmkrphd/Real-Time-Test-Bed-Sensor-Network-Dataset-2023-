# Real-Time-Test-Bed-Sensor-Network-Dataset-2023-
Dataset is constructed from a simulated or experimental test-bed setup designed for sensor network research.
The Real-Time Test-Bed Sensor Network Dataset 2023 comprises 2,000 real-time samples collected over the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, simulating data from a sensor network designed to evaluate the any future communication protocols. The data was generated using a virtual test-bed that reflects realistic environmental and operational conditions in sensor networks. The network topology consists of 100 sensor nodes uniformly deployed in a hexagonal grid layout, classified into cluster heads and data collectors. Key environmental parameters such as humidity (%) and temperature (Â°C) were recorded, alongside communication-specific metrics like signal strength (dBm), data packet size (kB), and transmission delay (ms). Additionally, energy consumption metrics (Energy_Level_J) and network dynamics, including event-triggered sensing, cluster formation (Cluster_ID), and fault statuses (Normal, Warning, Failure), were meticulously logged. The dataset emulates real-world scenarios with the integration of adaptive routing, dynamic clustering, and self-healing mechanisms, providing a comprehensive lead for future research.
